These keystrokes make the desired change on vim. They are not below 30 because the print line is exceeding 50 just by itself. 

    

2. Part 2 -
    
    + Question 1) Which of these two styles would you prefer using if you had to work on a program that you were running remotely, and why?


      Answer) It took me 56 seconds to do it the first way, and it took me 68 seconds to do it the second way because of a couple extra lines. In my opinion,
      editing the file locally then uploading it to the server was faster. And it was easier to keep track of the directories.
      
      
    + Question 2) What about the project or task might factor into your decision one way or another? (If nothing would affect your decision, say so and why!)
      
      
      Answer) If the task is better done locally then it would be easier for me. However, if it is a linux comand that cannot be run on my laptop, it would
      be easier if I upload it to the server first, and then do it.
