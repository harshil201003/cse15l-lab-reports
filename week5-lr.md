# WEEK 5 Lab Report

## Researching Commands 

The command that we will be discussing in detail will be `grep`. Grep takes a string and a file, and prints out all the lines in that file
that match the string. The first example is `grep -w`. This function of grep returns whole words instead of parts of the word. Example being if we search
for the string "lemon", it will only return the instances of the word "lemon" in the search file. Default grep would also return "lemonade" with "lemon".
The terminal code has been provided below.


`grep -w "string" (filename)`


An example of finding the word "four" in a file is given below -
